Nestled inside a big circular bay and protected from the high seas by a series of rocks forming a natural breakwater, Marsa Matrouh is a relatively secluded destination on Egypt's Mediterranean shore. It is the capital of the Matrouh Governorate, which extends from the 61st km of the Alexandria-Matrouh highway to the Egypt-Libyan border (450 km of coast), from East to West, and from the coast 350 km deep into the western desert of Egypt, including Siwa Oasis.
With long sandy white beaches and crystal clear waters, such as Agiba Beach and Gharam Beach, described by many as one of the most beautiful seashore landscapes in the world, many believe that Cleopatra herself bathed in the tranquil waters of Marsa Matrouh. The reputed spot, Cleopatra's Beach, is still accessible and you surely won't miss it during your visit. The coastal Mediterranean climate lends this town its moderation in summer and the cold in winter. The best times to visit are in May and September.
The water's colour ranges from blue to green, due to the depths differences in Matrouh's bay. The irregular sea ground forms an amazing underwater world of mountains, valleys and colourful fish species.
Marsa Matrouh is in the north-western corner of Egypt where Erwin Rommel, the desert fox himself, picked a cave near the shore to command operations during the Battle of El-Alamein. Rommel's cave's still there, it has been transformed into a "Rommel Museum" which you can visit today.
Marsa Matrouh's average temperature can reach highs of 28 C in summer and lows of 13 C in winter."            </tr>
