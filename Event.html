			 <h3> The importance of digital technologies in tourism, providing opportunities for innovation and preparing the sector for the future of work, is at the center&nbsp;of World Tourism Day 2018, to be celebrated in Budapest, Hungary (27 September 2018). 
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 World Tourism Day, celebrated every 27 September around the world, is a unique opportunity to raise awareness on tourism’s actual and potential contribution to sustainable development.
			<br>
			<br>
			This year’s World Tourism Day (WTD) will help to put the opportunities provided to tourism, by technological advances including big data, artificial intelligence and digital platforms, on the map of sustainable development. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) sees digital advances and innovation as part of the solution to the challenge of marrying continued growth with a more sustainable and responsible tourism sector.
			<br>
			<br>
			Harnessing innovation and digital advances provides tourism with opportunities to improve inclusiveness, local community empowerment and efficient resource management, among&nbsp;other objectives within the wider sustainable development agenda”, said UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili.
			<br>
			<br>
			The WTD official celebration will be held in Budapest, Hungary, a country enjoying steady growth of tourism backed by consistent policy support and a commitment to the digital future. Other celebrations will take place worldwide.
			<br>
			<br>
			The official celebration will also see the announcement of the semi-finalists of the 1st UNWTO Tourism Startup Competition, launched by UNWTO and Globalia to give visibility to startups with innovative ideas capable of revolutionizing the way we travel and enjoy tourism.
